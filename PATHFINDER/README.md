goal based pathfinding

Allow diagonals and incorporate some logic from Sebastion Lague's A* pathfinding.
Adjacent neighbors have a distance of 10 while diagonal neighbors have a distance of 14.
A cell's distance will be reset when a shorter path is found.  
The chain of parents will always be the shortest route.
